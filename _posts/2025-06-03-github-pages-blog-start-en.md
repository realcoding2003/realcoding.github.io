Hello! Today, we'll explore how to start a tech blog using GitHub Pages.

If you're a developer, you've probably thought about running your own tech blog at least once. GitHub Pages is an excellent service that allows you to host static websites for free.

## Why GitHub Pages?

Here are the reasons I chose GitHub Pages:

### 1. Completely Free
- Provides `username.github.io` domain at no cost
- Completely free hosting
- Automatic SSL certificate provision

### 2. Developer-Friendly
- Version control through Git
- Write posts in Markdown
- Built-in code syntax highlighting

### 3. Customization Freedom
- Theme customization through Jekyll
- Direct modification of HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Feature extension through plugins

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Create Repository

When creating a new repository on GitHub, set the name in the format `username.github.io`.

```bash
# Example
realcoding.github.io
```

### Step 2: Jekyll Configuration

Create a `_config.yml` file and add basic settings:

```yaml
title: Real Coding Blog
description: Development know-how and technical insights learned from real work
url: "https://realcoding.github.io"
baseurl: ""

# Author information
author:
  name: Kevin Park
  email: kevin@realcoding.blog

# Build settings
markdown: kramdown
highlighter: rouge
permalink: /:year/:month/:day/:title/

# Plugins
plugins:
  - jekyll-feed
  - jekyll-sitemap
  - jekyll-seo-tag
```

### Step 3: Write Your First Post

Create a file in the `_posts` directory with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "First Post"
date: 2025-06-04 14:30:00 +0900
categories: [Blog]
tags: [getting-started, github-pages]
---

Hello! This is my first post.

## Subheading

Write your content here.

```javascript
console.log("Hello, Blog!");
```
```

## Useful Tips

### 1. Setting Up Local Development Environment

```bash
# After installing Ruby
gem install bundler jekyll

# Create new Jekyll site
jekyll new my-blog
cd my-blog

# Run local server
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### 2. Custom Domain Setup

GitHub Pages makes it easy to set up custom domains:

1. Create a `CNAME` file in your repository
2. Enter your desired domain (e.g., `blog.example.com`)
3. Add CNAME record in DNS settings

### 3. SEO Optimization

```yaml
# Add to _config.yml
plugins:
  - jekyll-seo-tag

# Add metadata to each post
---
title: "Post Title"
description: "Brief description of the post"
image: /assets/images/post-thumbnail.jpg
---
```

## Conclusion

Starting a blog with GitHub Pages is simpler than you might think. Since it's free yet provides powerful features, it's an optimal choice for developers.
