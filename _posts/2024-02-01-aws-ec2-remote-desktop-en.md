**Automatic instance start/stop:**
```python
import boto3
import schedule
import time

def start_instance():
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='ap-northeast-2')
    ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=['i-1234567890abcdef0'])
    print("Instance started")

def stop_instance():
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='ap-northeast-2')
    ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=['i-1234567890abcdef0'])
    print("Instance stopped")

# Start at 8 AM, stop at 6 PM on weekdays
schedule.every().monday.at("08:00").do(start_instance)
schedule.every().monday.at("18:00").do(stop_instance)
# ... configure remaining days
```

#### 3. Backup and Snapshot Management

```bash
# Daily automatic backup setup
aws dlm create-lifecycle-policy \
  --description "Daily Desktop Backup" \
  --state ENABLED \
  --execution-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AWSDataLifecycleManagerDefaultRole \
  --policy-details '{
    "PolicyType": "EBS_SNAPSHOT_MANAGEMENT",
    "ResourceTypes": ["INSTANCE"],
    "TargetTags": [{"Key": "Environment", "Value": "Desktop"}],
    "Schedules": [{
      "Name": "DailyBackup",
      "CreateRule": {"Interval": 24, "IntervalUnit": "HOURS", "Times": ["03:00"]},
      "RetainRule": {"Count": 7}
    }]
  }'
```
