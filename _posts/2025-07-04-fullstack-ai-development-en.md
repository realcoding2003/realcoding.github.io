# Can One Person Really Develop Entire Projects? 200% AI Utilization with CDK + Lambda + Cursor

![Hero Image](/assets/images/posts/fullstack-ai-development/hero.png)
*Development environment managing everything from infrastructure to frontend with monorepo structure*

## 🤦‍♂️ How I Used to Develop in the Past

**Problem**: Creating one repository per Lambda function
- 10 projects = 10 repositories
- Copy-paste hell for common code
- Jumping between 10 repositories every deployment

**Current**: Managing everything in one project with CDK + Lambda + Cursor
- IaC code, server code, frontend code, demo pages all in one place
- AI understands the entire context and assists development
- One person can develop entire projects

```javascript
// Now managing everything in one project like this
project/
├── infrastructure/     # CDK code
├── lambda-functions/   # Server logic
├── frontend/          # Frontend
├── demo-pages/        # Demo pages
└── docs/              # Rulebook and guides
```

## 🚀 The Magic of Simultaneous Development Speed and Maintainability Improvement

### 200% Development Speed Improvement
**The Power of AI Context Sharing**
- Cursor understands the entire project structure
- Auto-generates server code by looking at infrastructure code
- Auto-generates frontend integration code by looking at server API
- Quickly adds new features with consistent patterns

**Real Experience**: Adding one new API
1. Define Lambda function in CDK (30 seconds)
2. Cursor generates server code based on existing patterns (1 minute)
3. Auto-generates frontend integration code (1 minute)
4. Deployment script follows existing patterns (30 seconds)

**Total: 3 minutes**. Used to take at least 30 minutes before.

### Dramatically Improved Maintainability
**Code Consistency Assurance**
```typescript
// All Lambda functions use the same pattern
export const handler = async (event: APIGatewayProxyEvent) => {
  try {
    // Apply common middleware
    const result = await processRequest(event);
    return successResponse(result);
  } catch (error) {
    return errorResponse(error);
  }
};
```

**Simplified Version Control**
- Track all changes in one repository
- Component-based folder structure instead of feature-based branches
- Deployment can be done all at once or selectively

## 💡 But There Were These Challenges Too

### Biggest Challenge: Rulebook Management
**The Trap of Massive Source Code**
- Too complex for AI to understand the entire project
- AI repeating past trial-and-error mistakes
- Inconsistent code patterns confusing AI

**Solution: Systematic Rulebook Creation**
```markdown
# Project Rulebook (docs/rulebook.md)

## 1. Lambda Function Writing Rules
- All functions use common/middleware.ts
- Error handling uses standardError class
- Environment variables managed in config/environment.ts

## 2. CDK Infrastructure Patterns
- Lambda functions use constructs/lambda-construct.ts
- API Gateway paths unified in kebab-case
- Project tags mandatory for all resources

## 3. Prohibited Actions
- Direct AWS SDK calls prohibited (use wrapper functions)
- Hardcoded ARNs prohibited (use CDK references)
- Use structured logging instead of console.log
```

When this rulebook is properly recognized by Cursor, AI develops with consistent patterns.

## 🎯 Now One Person Can Handle Entire Projects

### Benefits of MSA Design + Monorepo Management
**Separated Design, Integrated Management**

| Category | Old Method | Current Method |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Repository | Function-based separation | Project integration |
| Deployment | Individual deployment | Selective batch deployment |
| Code Reuse | Copy-paste | Common modules |
| AI Utilization | Limited | Full context |
| Development Speed | Slow | Fast |

### Actual Project Structure
```
my-fullstack-project/
├── cdk/
│   ├── lib/
│   │   ├── api-stack.ts      # API Gateway + Lambda
│   │   ├── frontend-stack.ts  # S3 + CloudFront
│   │   └── database-stack.ts  # DynamoDB
│   └── bin/app.ts
├── lambdas/
│   ├── user-service/
│   ├── auth-service/
│   └── common/               # Common utilities
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   └── dist/
├── demo/

└── docs/
    ├── rulebook.md           # Rulebook for AI
    └── architecture.md
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow with Cursor

### Process of Adding New Features
1. **Requirements Definition** (1 minute)
   - "Create user profile lookup API"

2. **Cursor Auto-generates** (2 minutes)
   - Add Lambda function to CDK stack
   - Implement Lambda function (based on rulebook)
   - Generate frontend integration code

3. **Deploy and Test** (2 minutes)
   - `npm run deploy`
   - Test immediately on demo page

**Total: 5 minutes**. This is the power of 200% AI utilization.

### Token Consumption Optimization Tips
**What I Learned Using Ultra Version**
- Well-made rulebook prevents AI from wandering
- Include only relevant files in context window
- Register frequently used patterns as snippets

```typescript
// Register frequently used Lambda function template as snippet
const lambdaTemplate = `
export const handler = async (event: APIGatewayProxyEvent) => {
  // Standard pattern based on rulebook
};
`;
```

## 💡 Conclusion: Solo Fullstack Development Became Reality

**Summary of Benefits**
- 200% development speed improvement
- Dramatically improved maintainability
- Consistent code quality through AI context sharing
- One person can develop entire projects

**Precautions**
- Rulebook management is key
- Initial structure design requires time investment
- Consider token consumption (Ultra version recommended)

Developing this way really makes a difference in productivity. I'm curious about how others with similar experiences manage their projects!
