# Building a Complete Tech Blog with Claude Desktop + MCP: The Reality of AI Pair Programming

## 🤔 Honest Confession: Years of Postponing a Tech Blog

To be honest, **I'd been thinking about creating a tech blog** for several years. Problems encountered during development, solutions I found, new technologies I learned... I thought it would be useful for me later and helpful to other developers too.

### 😅 But Why Did I Keep Postponing?

**1. The Hassle of Markdown Format**
```markdown
# How do I write titles?
## How many # should I use for subtitles?
- Should lists use - or *?
1. And how about numbered lists...
[Link](url) what was the format again?
```
It was bothersome to look up markdown syntax every time, and maintaining consistency wasn't easy either.

**2. Complex Initial Setup**
```bash
# Jekyll installation? Ruby version management?
gem install jekyll bundler
bundle init
# Which theme should I use? 
# How do I configure _config.yml?
# CSS customization?
```
Just to create one blog, there was a mountain of things to configure. I often got exhausted before even writing a single post.

**3. Continuous Updates and Maintenance**
```
- Need to add a comment system
- Google Analytics integration too
- SEO optimization also...
- I don't like the design
- Is it responsive?
```
Even after creating it once, there were too many things that needed continuous attention.

**4. The Perfectionist Trap**
```
"I should write a few basic posts first before starting"
"I wish the design was prettier..."
"The functionality seems a bit lacking..."
```
Eventually fell into infinite postponement mode with **"I'll do it properly later"**.

## 🚀 The Arrival of Claude Desktop + MCP: Game Changer

But from late 2024, I encountered the amazing combination of **Claude Desktop + MCP Server**.

### 🎯 "This Time Feels Different"

It was definitely different from existing AI tools:

```
Existing AI Tools:
"Write some code" → Copy-paste → Modify → Ask again

Claude Desktop + MCP:
"I want to build this" → Actual file creation → Immediate application → Real-time improvement → Auto deployment
```

Instead of simply providing code snippets, it felt like **a partner actually building projects together**.

### 💡 "Alright, Let's Do It Today!"

On the morning of June 4, 2025, I finally decided.

> **"Let's completely build a tech blog with Claude Desktop + MCP in one day!"**

And indeed... **I completed it in one day**. 😱

- **From Jekyll setup to deployment**
- **Writing 5 tech posts**
- **Google Analytics, AdSense integration**
- **Privacy policy page**
- **Complete responsive design**
- **Dark/light mode support**
- **Automated posting workflow**

And not by manually searching and configuring everything myself, but through **natural conversation** with Claude Desktop + MCP.

---

> **TL;DR**: I built a complete Jekyll-based tech blog using Claude Desktop + MCP Server. The hassles of markdown, complexity of configuration, maintenance burdens... All obstacles were resolved through AI pair programming. Sharing detailed real experience.

## 🛠️ Setting Up Claude Desktop + MCP Environment

### 1. Claude Desktop Installation and Configuration

```bash
# Download and install Claude Desktop

```

### 2. Local MCP Server Setup

**Project Initialization**:
```bash
mkdir blog-mcp-server
cd blog-mcp-server
npm init -y
npm install @anthropic-ai/mcp-sdk
```

**MCP Server Implementation (mcp-server.js)**:
```javascript
import { Server } from '@anthropic-ai/mcp-sdk/server/index.js';
import { StdioServerTransport } from '@anthropic-ai/mcp-sdk/server/stdio.js';
import { CallToolRequestSchema, ListToolsRequestSchema } from '@anthropic-ai/mcp-sdk/types.js';
import fs from 'fs/promises';
import path from 'path';
import { execSync } from 'child_process';

const server = new Server({
  name: 'blog-automation-server',
  version: '1.0.0',
});

// Register blog automation tools
server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => {
  return {
    tools: [
      {
        name: 'create_blog_post',
        description: 'Creates a new blog post',
        inputSchema: {
          type: 'object',
          properties: {
            title: { type: 'string' },
            content: { type: 'string' },
            categories: { type: 'array', items: { type: 'string' } },
            tags: { type: 'array', items: { type: 'string' } }
          }
        }
      },
      {
        name: 'auto_deploy',
        description: 'Git commit and GitHub Pages deployment',
        inputSchema: {
          type: 'object',
          properties: {
            message: { type: 'string' }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  };
});
```

     ↓  
AI: Present improvement plan (color, typography, layout)
     ↓
User: "Act" command
     ↓
AI: CSS modification + real-time application
```

**Actual Conversation Example**:
```
👤 User: The current blog header looks too plain. Can you change it to 
         something more professional and modern?

🤖 Claude: I'll analyze the current header style.

[Plan Mode Analysis Result]
- Current: Simple text logo + basic navigation
- Issues: Lack of visual impact, absence of branding elements
- Improvement plan:
  1. Gradient background + glassmorphism effect
  2. Enhanced logo typography
  3. Navigation hover animations
  4. Enhanced dark mode support

Confidence: 98%

👤 User: Great! Act

🤖 Claude: I'll update the header style.
```

### 2. Style Component System

**Using CSS Variables**:
```css
:root {
  /* Color system */
  --primary-gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
  --glass-bg: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  --glass-border: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  
  /* Typography */
  --heading-font: 'Inter', -apple-system, sans-serif;
  --mono-font: 'JetBrains Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace;
  
  /* Spacing */
  --header-height: 80px;

## 🎯 Core Value of Project Configuration

### 1. Consistent Quality

**Before (Before project configuration)**:
- Different style posts every time
- Missing metadata
- Irregular category system

**After (After project configuration)**:
- Unified posting format
- Complete SEO optimization
- Systematic information structure

### 2. Revolutionary Work Speed

```
Existing Posting Process:
Idea → Draft writing → Markdown conversion → Image processing → 
Metadata writing → File creation → Git commit → Deployment verification
(Time required: 2-3 hours)

AI Automation Process:  
Idea → "Act" command → Complete
(Time required: 5-10 minutes)
```

### 3. Focus on Creativity

Now I can focus on **"What to write?"** instead of **"How to write?"**:

- Markdown syntax concerns ❌
- Metadata configuration ❌  
- Filename rules ❌
- Git commands ❌

Instead:
- Content helpful to readers ✅
- Sharing practical experience ✅
- Technical insights ✅
- Community contribution ✅

## 🚧 Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **Insufficient Image Automation**: No support for automatic screenshot, diagram generation
2. **Lack of SEO Analysis**: No keyword competition, search volume analysis features  
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Lack of automatic checks for page loading speed, Core Web Vitals

### Improvement Plans

**Phase 1: Image Automation**
```javascript
// Planned features
const imageAutomation = {
  screenshots: "Puppeteer-based automatic screenshots",
  diagrams: "Automatic Mermaid, PlantUML generation",
  thumbnails: "AI-based automatic thumbnail generation"
};
```

**Phase 2: SEO Intelligence**
```javascript
const seoFeatures = {
  keywordResearch: "Google Keyword Planner API integration",
  competitorAnalysis: "Top ranking post analysis",
  contentOptimization: "Readability, keyword density optimization"
};
```

**Phase 3: Analytics Automation**
```javascript
const analyticsAutomation = {
  performanceMonitoring: "Lighthouse CI integration",
  userEngagement: "Google Analytics automatic reports",
  contentPerformance: "Recommended topics based on popular posts"
};
```
